Sparse, repetitive, and metallic.  In a bustling, urban setting, one hears the rhythmic hum of cars on the road, intermittently punctuated by the mechanical sounds of engines and the occasional honk from passing vehicles. The scene then shifts to the ground, where a large, slithering presence is noticed, adding a sense of wildness to the otherwise mundane city life. Time appears to have warped as an old audio clip from Berlin Alexanderplatz in the 1920s echoes through the air, bringing with it a rich historical resonance. A certain Argentinean flair seems to permeate this eclectic environment, making for an intriguing blend of contemporary city life and distant memories.
