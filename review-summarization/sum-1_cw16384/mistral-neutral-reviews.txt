 This piece for viola and fixed media is a captivating exploration of soundscapes that seamlessly blends organic warmth and synthetic coolness. The haunting melodies on the viola weave through layers of electronic textures, creating a dynamic interplay between live instrumentation and pre-recorded elements. Each note resonates with a unique blend of resonances and manipulations, evoking both intimacy and vast expanses within the listener.

The harmonic structure is complex yet subtle, avoiding traditional resolutions in favor of dissonant chords that shift unpredictably. The rich, warm tones of the viola often merge with the electronic textures, creating hybrid sonorities that feel both familiar and alien. Moments of silence serve as punctuation points, allowing the listener to absorb the emotional weight of each section.

The composition draws you into a journey through shifting moods and sonic landscapes. It showcases the power of blending acoustic and digital elements, crafting a narrative that is thought-provoking as it is beautiful. The result is an immersive auditory experience that invites reflection on the boundaries between live and pre-recorded sound.
