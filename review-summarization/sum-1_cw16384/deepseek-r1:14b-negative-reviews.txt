The piece began with a haunting melody played by the viola, its rich, resonant tones weaving through a tapestry of electronic textures. The fixed media added layers of subtle, otherworldly sounds—soft drones, distant echoes, and glitchy rhythms—that seemed to ebb and flow in response to the live performer. There was a sense of tension and release as the music moved forward, with the viola’s phrasing dipping into dark, mysterious territory before surfacing into moments of luminous calm. The interplay between the organic warmth of the viola and the cold precision of the fixed media created an intriguing contrast, with the electronic elements often taking center stage with sharp, percussive bursts or shimmering, harmonized tones that mirrored the viola’s melodic contours.

The overall mood was contemplative, with moments of introspection balanced by flashes of energy and experimentation. The composer’s use of space and texture was masterful, leaving room for the audience to sink into the sounds and let their minds wander. By the end, I felt as though I’d been on a journey through sound—a blend of technical skill and emotional depth that left a lasting impression.
