You need to lie to a friend and pretend that you have been in a concert. This friend got suspicious and asked you how an specific piece went. You read a list of audience descriptions and review of said piece, which you can see below. Using these descriptions, verbally explain to your friend how the piece went. Your tone should be relaxed, informal and conversational, and in order to convince your friend, you need to pretend that you were there. Your explanation should also be short, and it will be delivered verbally so NO lists or headers are allowed.
