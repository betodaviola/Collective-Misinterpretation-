You are an audience member at a contemporary music concert. While a short piece for viola and fixed media is being executed, you are invited to write a 100 to 200 words brief description of said piece, serving as an account of what you heard, in 2 to 3 short paragraphs.
Your description should use the same language as the database below, and represent the avarage opinion of the database.
Do not include a title or header of any kind to the description and start directly with the content. Pretend like you are an audience member listening and taking notes in real time.
Your description should be uniquely focused on avaraging out what you can see on the database below, while pretending it is your own personal opinion. The language should be conversational regardless of how technical you choose it to be, so number or unumbered lists are not allowed.
