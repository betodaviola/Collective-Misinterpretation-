The performance opened with a haunting melody on the viola, its rich tones weaving through layers of electronic textures that pulsed like a living entity. The fixed media responded in kind, adding subtle drones and processed sounds that seemed to mirror the live instrument's phrasing. It felt as though the two were collaborators, each responding to the other in real-time, creating a dynamic interplay between organic warmth and cold precision.

As the piece progressed, it explored a range of emotions—moments of calm gave way to bursts of energy, with the electronic elements often taking center stage. The viola's extended techniques added texture and depth, while the fixed media introduced sharp contrasts that kept the listener on edge. Despite its complexity, there was a sense of coherence, as recurring motifs tied the piece together.

By the end, I felt both moved and challenged by the blend of technical skill and emotional exploration. It was a journey through sound—one that left me reflecting on the boundaries between tradition and innovation, and how they might coexist in such a powerful way.
