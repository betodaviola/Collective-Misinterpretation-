 The piece for viola and fixed media presents a mesmerizing blend of organic and electronic sounds, creating a haunting yet expansive soundscape that invites both reflection and engagement. The viola's delicate phrasing is interwoven with processed textures, each note resonating beyond its immediate form to dissolve into a web of harmonies and manipulations. Fixed media elements add layers of shimmering electronics, occasionally mirroring the viola's melodic contour in a distant space or introducing sharp, percussive interventions that disrupt the flow.

The piece avoids traditional resolutions, instead favoring dissonant chords that gradually shift into one another, building a sense of instability and curiosity. The timbre of the viola is rich and warm yet often seems to merge with the electronic textures, creating hybrid sonorities that feel both familiar and alien. Moments of silence are just as impactful as the sound itself, serving as punctuation points that allow the listener to absorb the emotional weight of each section.

The interplay between these elements creates a sense of tension and release, drawing the listener into a world where boundaries between live and pre-recorded sound blur. By the end, it leaves an impression of technical innovation and emotional depth, offering a journey through shifting moods and sonic landscapes that is as thought-provoking as it is beautiful. The composition strikes a delicate balance between experimentation and accessibility, provoking introspection while remaining captivating throughout.
