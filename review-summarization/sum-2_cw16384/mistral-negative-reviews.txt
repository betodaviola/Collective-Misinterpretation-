 In this piece for viola and fixed media, the music began with a hauntingly beautiful melody from the viola, echoing through a tapestry of electronic textures that seemed to pulse and shimmer in response. The fixed media elements created an intricate backdrop that often mirrored the contours of the viola's melodic lines, creating a dialogue between organic warmth and cold precision. As the piece progressed, moments of tension and release emerged as the harmony shifted unpredictably, with dissonant intervals and unexpected harmonic juxtapositions that evoked feelings of introspection and unease.

Throughout the performance, the fixed media added depth and complexity to the soundscape, introducing layers of processed sounds—echoes, delays, and subtle tonal shifts—that expanded the auditory experience beyond the physical space. The overall mood was contemplative, with moments of introspection balanced by flashes of energy and experimentation. By the end, I felt as though I'd been on a journey through sound, one that left me reflective and oddly uplifted, marveling at the ways technology can extend and amplify the expressive potential of a single instrument. The piece was a unique collaboration between human expression and technology, leaving an impression of both technical brilliance and emotional depth that resonated long after the final note faded away.
