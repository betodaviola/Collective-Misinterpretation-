 The piece for viola and fixed media unfolds as a haunting interplay between organic and electronic sounds, creating a sense of intimacy and expansiveness. The viola's delicate phrasing weaves through processed textures where each note resonates beyond its immediate form, dissolving into a web of reverberations and manipulations. Fixed media elements add layers of shimmering electronics, sometimes mirroring the viola's melodic contour in a distant, echoing space while other times introducing sharp, percussive interventions that disrupt the flow.

The harmonies avoid traditional resolutions, instead favoring dissonant chords that gradually shift into one another, building a sense of instability and curiosity. The timbre of the viola is rich and warm yet often seems to merge with the electronic textures, creating hybrid sonorities that feel both familiar and alien. Silences are just as impactful as the sound itself, serving as punctuation points that allow the listener to absorb the emotional weight of each section.

The balance between technical innovation and emotional depth is striking. The piece offers a journey through shifting moods and sonic landscapes, leaving the listener with a profound sense of awe at the creativity on display. It's a testament to the power of blending acoustic and digital elements, crafting a narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is beautiful.
