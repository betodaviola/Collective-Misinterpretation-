 The piece for viola and fixed media unfolds as a delicate dance between organic and electronic elements, creating a soundscape that is both intimate and expansive. The viola's melody weaves through intricate layers of processed electronics, where each note seems to resonate beyond its immediate form, dissolving into a web of harmonies and manipulations. Fixed media elements shimmer with electronic textures, sometimes mirroring the viola's melodic contour in a distant, reverberant space, while other times introducing abrupt, percussive interventions that disrupt the flow.

The harmony avoids traditional resolutions, instead favoring dissonant chords that shift gradually, building a sense of instability and curiosity. The timbre of the viola is rich and warm, yet it often seems to merge with the electronic textures, creating hybrid sonorities that feel both familiar and alien. Moments of silence serve as punctuation points, allowing listeners to absorb the emotional weight of each section.

The interplay between these elements creates a sense of tension and release, drawing the listener into a world where the boundaries between live and pre-recorded sound blur. Overall, the piece strikes a balance between technical innovation and emotional depth, offering a journey through shifting moods and sonic landscapes that is thought-provoking as it is beautiful.
