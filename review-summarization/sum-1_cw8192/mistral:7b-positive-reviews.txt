 This piece is a mesmerizing blend of viola and electronic media, creating an immersive soundscape that oscillates between intimacy and grandeur. The viola's rich tones weave seamlessly with the electronic textures, ranging from delicate pulses to enveloping washes of sound. The performer skillfully manipulates the instrument to produce ethereal harmonics and subtle glissandos, mirroring the fixed media's intricate layers.

As you listen, the music takes you on a journey that begins with tension, then gradually shifts toward moments of clarity and resolution. The viola's extended techniques—like rapid bowing and overtone manipulation—add urgency and rawness, while the fixed media's pulsations and drones ground you in the moment.

The interplay between the live and pre-recorded elements feels like a collaboration, crafting something greater than either could achieve alone. The emotional depth and inventiveness of this piece are striking, leaving a lasting impression long after the final note fades away. It's a testament to the power of merging tradition with modernity, offering an engaging and emotionally resonant experience.
