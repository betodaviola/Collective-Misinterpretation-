 This captivating piece for viola and fixed media is a mesmerizing blend of organic warmth and digital innovation. The haunting melody of the viola is interwoven with electronic textures, creating an immersive soundscape that evokes both introspection and unease. The interplay between the two elements, at times harmonious and other times dissonant, is seamless, blurring the line between live performance and pre-recorded audio.

Throughout the composition, there are subtle shifts in mood as the music ebbs and flows, building tension and releasing it just as suddenly. The electronic elements introduce rhythmic pulses, processed drones, and manipulated samples that defy conventional meter, creating a sense of unpredictability. The timbre of the viola, rich yet brittle, contrasts starkly with the cold precision of the fixed media.

Emotionally, the piece journeys through introspection and discomfort, leaving listeners questioning whether it has truly resolved or simply stopped. The overall impression is challenging, perhaps even alienating at times, but undeniably compelling in its ability to provoke thought and emotion through sound alone. Despite the abstract nature of the composition, the balance between live instrumentation and pre-recorded elements creates a unique auditory experience that lingers long after the final note fades.
