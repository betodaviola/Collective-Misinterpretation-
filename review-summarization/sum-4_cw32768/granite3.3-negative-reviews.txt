Alright, here's how I'd describe the concert to my friend, keeping it casual and convincing:

"Dude, it was wild! The piece started with this super ethereal viola melody that kinda felt like it was floating in space. Then these electronic sounds kicked in, not overpowering but definitely adding this deep, otherworldly atmosphere. It was like the viola and electronics were in this intense conversation, pushing against each other, but still making sense together.

There were moments of real tension, especially when they'd shift from these calm, introspective parts to sudden bursts of energy. The electronic textures would change rapidly, going from smooth and ambient to sharp and metallic—it kept me guessing! 

Overall, it was this contemplative yet experimental thing. It felt like a journey through sound, where each element—whether it's the viola’s warm tones or those cold, digital echoes—was pushing boundaries without losing that human touch. It left me feeling kinda reflective afterward, but also a bit unresolved, in that good way where you're still processing it."
