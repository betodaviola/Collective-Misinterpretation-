The piece was absolutely captivating! It started with this haunting melody on the viola, so rich and resonant, weaving through layers of electronic textures that shimmered like they were from another world. The interplay between the live instrument and the pre-recorded elements was seamless—it felt almost like a conversation where each sound responded to the other, creating this dynamic tension and release.

At times, it was so intimate, like you could really feel the emotion in every note of the viola, and then suddenly, the electronics would kick in with these sharp, percussive bursts that added this exciting contrast. It kept you on your toes, not sure what was coming next but totally engaged in the journey.

The mood shifted throughout—it had moments of calm introspection, where it felt like you were floating in a quiet space, and then it would build up to something more intense with these layered harmonies and intricate patterns. The blend of organic warmth and cold, processed sounds was so intriguing, making me think about memory and transformation.

By the end, it left me in this unresolved wonder, like it had taken you on this emotional rollercoaster without giving a clear answer—just this lingering impression that stuck with you long after it ended. It was such a unique experience, balancing technical innovation with real depth, and I’m still trying to unpack all its layers!
