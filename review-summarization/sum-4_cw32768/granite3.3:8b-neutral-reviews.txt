Alright, here's a conversational explanation for your friend, drawing from the provided descriptions:

"You know how it went man, it was deep. The viola started off with this haunting melody, real subtle and ethereal. Then these electronic textures kicked in, layering underneath like a dreamy backdrop. It was this beautiful tension between the warm, organic sound of the viola and the sharp, almost cold electronics.

The music moved through these moments of calm introspection, then suddenly surprised you with bursts of energy. It felt like a conversation—sometimes harmonious, sometimes clashing. There were these extended techniques on the viola that made it sound otherworldly, almost merging with the electronics.

The whole thing was unpredictable, with harmonies shifting unexpectedly and the fixed media adding layers of sound that echoed and reverberated. It blended live performance seamlessly with pre-recorded stuff, blurring the line between what's real and what's processed. 

Emotionally, it was all over the place—unsettling yet captivating, leaving you on edge but eager to hear more. Overall, it was a unique blend of technical prowess and emotional depth, like stepping into another world through sound."
