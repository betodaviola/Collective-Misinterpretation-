The piece began with a hauntingly delicate melody on the viola, its rich tones weaving through a tapestry of electronic textures that pulsed and shimmered in response. The interplay between the organic warmth of the viola and the cold precision of the fixed media created an intriguing contrast—like a conversation between two voices, one human and one machine. As the music progressed, it shifted between moments of calm introspection and bursts of energy, with the electronic elements adding layers of depth and unpredictability to the soundscape. The composer’s use of space and texture was masterful, leaving room for the audience to sink into the sound and let their minds wander. By the end, I felt as though I’d been on a journey through sound—a blend of technical skill and emotional depth that left a lasting impression.

The overall mood was contemplative yet dynamic, oscillating between introspection and subtle urgency. The fixed media elements were not merely background but active collaborators, often taking center stage with sharp, percussive bursts or shimmering harmonies that mirrored the viola’s melodic contours. Despite its complexity, there was a cohesion in the way the piece balanced beauty and unease, drawing the listener deeper into its sonic world. It was both intimate and expansive, leaving me reflective yet oddly uplifted by the skillful blending of tradition and innovation.
