Okay, so I went to this concert, right? And there was this piece for viola and fixed media that really stuck with me. It started off with this haunting melody on the viola—so rich and resonant, but then it was paired with these electronic textures that were both shimmering and unsettling. The interplay between the live instrument and the pre-recorded stuff was seamless, like they were having a conversation. One minute it felt intimate, like you could feel every note in your chest, and the next it was expansive, enveloping you in this huge soundscape.

The electronics added layers of depth, with these processed drones and delays that made it feel like the music was happening in multiple dimensions. There were moments where the viola’s melody would dissolve into a web of resonances and manipulations, creating this eerie yet beautiful tension. And then, just when you thought things couldn’t get more intense, there’d be these sharp, percussive interventions that shook you out of your calm.

Harmonically, it was all over the place in a good way—no traditional resolutions, just shifting dissonant chords that built a sense of instability and curiosity. It felt like an emotional journey, oscillating between introspection and propulsion, with moments of silence that were as impactful as the sound itself. By the end, I was left feeling like I’d been on this sonic adventure,Equal parts awe and unease, but in the best way possible. It was technical but deeply emotional, blending organic and digital elements into something truly unique.
