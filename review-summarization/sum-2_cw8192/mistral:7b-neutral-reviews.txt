 The piece for viola and fixed media presented a captivating blend of organic and electronic sounds that created a hauntingly beautiful soundscape. The delicate phrasing of the viola intertwined seamlessly with processed textures, each note resonating in an expansive yet intimate space. Fixed media elements provided intricate layers of shimmering electronics, mirroring the viola's melodic contour or introducing sharp, percussive interventions to disrupt its flow.

The harmonies were complex and dissonant, favoring gradual shifts over traditional resolutions, building an atmosphere of instability and curiosity. The timbre of the viola was rich and warm but often seemed to merge with the electronic textures, creating hybrid sonorities that felt both familiar and alien. Moments of silence served as punctuation points, allowing the listener to fully absorb the emotional weight of each section.

The interplay between these elements resulted in a sense of tension and release, drawing listeners into a world where boundaries between live and pre-recorded sound blurred. The journey through shifting moods and sonic landscapes was testament to the power of blending acoustic and digital elements, crafting a narrative that was as thought-provoking as it was beautiful.
