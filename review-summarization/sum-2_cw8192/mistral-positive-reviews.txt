 This contemporary piece for viola and fixed media offers an immersive sonic journey, characterized by its intricate blend of organic and electronic elements. The viola's haunting melodies weave seamlessly with the rich tapestry of electronics, creating a dynamic interplay that transcends traditional boundaries between instruments.

The harmony is complex yet purposeful, shifting between dissonance and resolution in unexpected ways. The fixed media adds layers of texture, sometimes mirroring or augmenting the viola's phrases and other times introducing stark contrast through processed sounds. This tension creates a sense of anticipation and curiosity that drives the listener forward.

Despite its technical complexity, there is a clear emotional depth to the music. Moments of introspection and melancholy give way to bursts of energy and resolve, painting vivid sonic landscapes that resonate with universal feelings. The use of extended techniques on the viola, combined with the electronic manipulations of the fixed media, adds a raw edge to the melodies, giving them an urgency that feels both personal and accessible.

The overall atmosphere is one of quiet intensity, as each note, phrase, and processed sound contributes to a mesmerizing journey through varying emotional territories. The seamless interplay between live and pre-recorded elements creates a cohesive whole that leaves a lasting impression of inventiveness and emotional resonance.

In essence, this piece is a testament to the power of collaboration between acoustic and electronic mediums. It challenges traditional notions of music and offers listeners an auditory experience that is as thought-provoking as it is emotionally moving.
