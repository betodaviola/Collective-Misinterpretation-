The piece for viola and fixed media was an intriguing yet disjointed exploration of soundscapes and textures. The viola’s intricate melodies were interspersed with electronic elements, creating moments of tension and release. However, the interplay between the live instrument and pre-recorded media often felt uneven, with the timing and balance struggling to synchronize cohesively. While there were moments of technical brilliance—such as the way the viola’s timbre was manipulated to create haunting overtones—the overall execution lacked a clear direction or emotional core.

The fixed media added layers of processed sounds that ranged from ethereal to jarring, but these elements frequently overshadowed the soloist rather than complementing it. The harmonic structure, though ambitious in its unpredictability, often felt unresolved, leaving me disoriented rather than challenged. Despite its avant-garde aspirations, the piece lacked a unifying theme or emotional resonance, making it difficult to fully engage with.

In the end, while the concept showed potential, the execution fell short of delivering a meaningful listening experience. The combination of live and electronic elements felt more gimmicky than innovative, and the lack of focus in both structure and emotion left me feeling underwhelmed. It was an opportunity missed to create something truly impactful.
