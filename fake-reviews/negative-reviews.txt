The fixed media added texture—sometimes shimmering and ethereal, other times jagged and dissonant—as if to challenge the boundaries between consonance and noise. The interplay between the live performer and the pre-recorded elements created a sense of tension and release, drawing the listener into a soundscape that felt both intimate and expansive.

Mood-wise, the piece oscillated between introspection and unease. The electronic manipulations of the viola's timbre—reversed, filtered, looped—gave it a ghostly quality, as if the instrument were speaking from another dimension. There were moments where the melody seemed to dissolve into chaos, only to reemerge in unexpected tonalities that hinted at unresolved tension. This unpredictability kept the listener on edge, yet it also felt deliberate, as though the composer intended to disorient rather than comfort.

While the technical execution was impressive, I found myself struggling to connect with the piece on a deeper emotional level. The constant shifting between tonal and atonal regions left me feeling adrift, without a clear anchor in the harmonic or melodic structure. It felt more like an experiment in sound design than a narrative exploration of emotion, leaving me both intrigued and somewhat alienated by its abstract nature.
