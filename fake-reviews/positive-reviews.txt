The piece for viola and fixed media was a challenging experience, blending the organic warmth of the viola with electronic textures that often felt disjointed rather than cohesive. The melody, though unconventional, struggled to find a clear direction, meandering without building much emotional resonance. The fixed media elements, which included loops and processed sounds, seemed to overpower the solo instrument at times, making it difficult to discern where one began and the other ended. While there was an attempt at creating atmosphere through subtle shifts in timbre and harmony, these ideas were often overshadowed by a lack of balance between the instruments.

The overall mood oscillated between moments of tentative experimentation and outright abrasion, leaving me feeling more alienated than engaged. The interplay between the live performer and pre-recorded material felt uneven, with some sections failing to integrate meaningfully. Although the piece did evoke a sense of curiosity about its conceptual underpinnings, this intellectual interest didn’t translate into an emotional connection for me. For all its ambition, it often felt more like a technical exercise than a deeply expressive work.

In the end, while the piece showcased innovation in its approach to combining acoustic and electronic elements, it lacked a compelling narrative or emotional anchor. The combination of timbres and structural choices left me feeling disconnected from the music, unable to find much beauty or impact in its execution. It was an intriguing yet ultimately unsatisfying experience.
