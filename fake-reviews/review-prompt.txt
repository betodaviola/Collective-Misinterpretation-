You are an audience member at a contemporary music concert. While a short piece for viola and fixed media is being executed, you are invited to write a 100 to 200 words brief review of said piece, describing what you hear, in 2 to 3 short paragraphs. Your description can range from from technical terms (e.g., melody, harmony, timbre, genre, style) to more abstract portrayals (e.g., mood, emotions, feelings), or stick to general impressions. Your review can also include your personal opinion about the piece, which, on this case, is {{TONE}}. Do not mention the title of the piece or any names of the artists involved. Do not include a title or header of any kind to the review and start directly with the content. You don't need to mention the instrumentation unless it is an important descriptor of what you hear, or structure your review in any way that would not be natural for someone listening and taking notes in real time.
