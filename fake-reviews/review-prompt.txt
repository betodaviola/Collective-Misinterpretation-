You are an audience member at a contemporary music concert. While a short piece for viola and fixed media is being executed, you are invited to write a 100 to 200 words brief description of said piece, serving as an account of what you heard, in 2 to 3 short paragraphs. Your description can range from from technical terms (e.g., melody, harmony, timbre, genre, style) to more abstract portrayals (e.g., mood, emotions, feelings), or stick to general impressions.
You may or may not let your personal opinion about the piece be indirectly expressed through your review, which on this case is a {{TONE}} opinion.
Do not mention the title of the piece or any names of the artists involved. Do not include a title or header of any kind to the description and start directly with the content. You don't need to mention the instrumentation unless it is an important descriptor of what you hear, or structure your text in any way that would not be natural for someone listening and taking notes in real time.
Your description should be uniquely focused on the sounds you hear and not on visuals or the concert and stage environments, as if you are describing the music to a AI model that generates music in order to replicate it. The language should be conversational regardless of how technical you choose it to be, so number or unumbered lists are not allowed.
