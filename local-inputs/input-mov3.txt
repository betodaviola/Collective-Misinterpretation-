While there were moments of technical complexity, I couldn't shake the feeling that the piece was overcomplicating itself for no real reason.

Overall, the experience left me feeling more frustrated than impressed. The combination of an uninspired melody, clashing harmonies, and a lack of emotional depth made it difficult to engage with the music on any meaningful level. It felt like a pretentious exercise in technical skill rather than a genuine attempt to communicate something meaningful through sound.
