 The piece for viola and fixed media is a hauntingly beautiful blend of organic warmth and electronic textures that explores the interplay between these contrasting elements. It opens with a delicate, resonant melody played on the viola, which weaves through a tapestry of subtle, otherworldly sounds created by the fixed media. These processed tones pulse, shimmer, and respond to the live performer in an intricate dance that feels both organic and alien.

The overall mood is contemplative yet dynamic, oscillating between introspective calm and bursts of energy that reflect experimentation and innovation. The composer masterfully uses space and texture to create a sonic world that draws listeners in, inviting them to sink into the sounds and let their minds wander. By combining technical skill with emotional depth, the piece leaves a lasting impression that is at once challenging and deeply moving. Despite moments of tension and release, there is an underlying sense of unity between the viola's human touch and the fixed media's endless possibilities, creating something greater than either could achieve alone.
