 This contemporary piece for viola and fixed media is a hauntingly beautiful exploration of tension and release, where the organic warmth of the live instrument interacts with electronic textures in an otherworldly dance. The viola's melody weaves through layers of processed sounds, creating a rich tapestry that oscillates between introspection and experimentation. The fixed media backdrop pulses and shimmers, responding to the viola’s phrasing in a seamless conversation that feels both intimate and expansive.

The interplay between the live performer and pre-recorded elements creates an intriguing contrast, with the electronic elements acting as active collaborators rather than background noise. These sounds introduce subtle rhythms, distant echoes, and glitchy pulses that shift in response to the viola’s melodic contours. The resulting dialogue between organic and digital feels both mysterious and familiar, drawing listeners into a unique sonic world.

The overall mood is contemplative, with moments of introspection balanced by bursts of energy and innovation. The composer's masterful use of space and texture leaves room for the listener to sink into the sounds and let their minds wander. By the end, you feel as though you’ve embarked on a journey through sound—an emotionally charged collaboration that combines technical skill with emotional depth, leaving a lasting impression.
