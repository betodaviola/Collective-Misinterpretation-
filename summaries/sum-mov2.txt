 This contemporary piece for viola and fixed media presents a hauntingly beautiful melody played on the viola, intertwined with electronic textures that add layers of depth and complexity. The live performer's melodies are often echoed, expanded, or contrasted by the fixed media, creating an intricate dialogue between organic warmth and cold precision. The overall mood is contemplative yet dynamic, oscillating between moments of introspection and bursts of energy.

The composer skillfully manipulates space and texture, drawing the listener into a sonic world that feels at once familiar and alien. The electronic elements are active collaborators, often taking center stage with sharp, percussive bursts or shimmering harmonies that mirror the viola's melodic contours. The tension between order and chaos is palpable, creating a unique and immersive listening experience.

Although each performance varies slightly due to the improvisational nature of the fixed media, they all share a sense of exploration and experimentation. This experimental edge might not resonate with everyone, but for those open to abstract soundscapes, this piece offers a thought-provoking journey through beauty and unease. It is a testament to the composer's ability to bridge tradition and innovation, creating something that feels deeply personal yet universally resonant.
