 This contemporary piece for viola and fixed media begins with a hauntingly beautiful melody from the viola, which weaves through electronic textures that create a sense of depth and complexity. The live instrument's tone is rich and resonant, while the electronic elements respond and adapt in real-time to the performer's phrasing, creating an intriguing interplay between organic warmth and cold precision. The piece showcases both subtle and harsh sounds, from ethereal harmonies to dissonant intervals, building a tension that is at once introspective and expansive.

As the music progresses, moments of silence contrast with bursts of vibrant energy, while the electronic manipulations shift unpredictably, adding layers of processed tones and textures that blur the boundaries between performer and technology. The composer employs extended techniques on the viola to add unexpected twists to the melody, intertwining organic warmth with inorganic sheen, creating a soundscape that feels both familiar and alien.

The overall structure is dynamic and evolving, oscillating between calm introspection and moments of experimentation, while leaving room for the audience to sink into the sounds and reflect upon their own thoughts and emotions. By the end, the listener is left with a lingering impression of technical brilliance, emotional depth, and a unique collaboration between human expression and technological innovation.
