 This piece for viola and fixed media offers a captivating and introspective musical experience that weaves together the organic warmth of live instrumentation with the cold precision of electronic manipulation. The viola's haunting, ethereal melodies are met with layers of shimmering electronics in a dynamic conversation between past and present. Unpredictable shifts in dynamics, dissonant harmonies, and subtle timbre contrasts create a sense of tension and release that keeps the listener engaged throughout.

The piece evokes a feeling of introspection and unease as it journeys through unresolved emotional territory. The delicate balance between technical skill and emotional resonance leaves a lasting impression, inviting further reflection on its unique soundscape and challenging the listener to engage deeply with both the technical and emotional dimensions of the music. Despite its abstract qualities, this composition is a testament to the power of blending acoustic and digital elements to craft a narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is beautiful.
