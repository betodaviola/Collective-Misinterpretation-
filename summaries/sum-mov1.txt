 This piece for viola and fixed media is a captivating exploration of organic and electronic sounds that weaves a delicate balance between intimacy and expansiveness. The viola's haunting melodies intertwine seamlessly with processed textures, creating a dynamic soundscape that evokes both introspection and unease. As the music progresses, harmonically rich phrases shift unexpectedly, blurring boundaries between traditional resolutions and dissonant intervals. The fixed media elements add layers of shimmering electronics, sometimes mirroring the viola's melodic contour or introducing sharp percussive interventions that disrupt the flow.

The timbre of the viola is rich and warm, often merging with electronic textures to create hybrid sonorities that feel both familiar and alien. Silence plays a significant role in this piece, punctuating moments for reflection and intensifying emotional weight during each section. The overall atmosphere oscillates between contemplation and agitation, inviting the listener on a thought-provoking journey through shifting moods and sonic landscapes. It is a testament to the power of blending acoustic and digital elements, crafting a narrative that is as moving as it is beautiful.
