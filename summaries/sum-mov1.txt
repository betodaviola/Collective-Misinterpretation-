 This piece for viola and fixed media offers a haunting blend of organic and electronic sounds, crafting a soundscape that is both intimate and expansive. The viola's delicate phrasing weaves through processed textures, creating a conversation between live instrumentation and pre-recorded elements. The fixed media adds layers of shimmering electronics, sometimes mirroring the viola's melodic contour in a distant, reverberant space, while other times introducing sharp, percussive interventions that disrupt the flow.

The harmony avoids traditional resolutions, favoring dissonant chords that gradually shift into one another, building a sense of instability and curiosity. The timbre of the viola is rich and warm yet often merges with electronic textures, creating hybrid sonorities that feel both familiar and alien. Moments of silence serve as punctuation points, allowing the listener to absorb each section's emotional weight.

The piece balances technical innovation and emotional depth, taking listeners on a journey through shifting moods and sonic landscapes. It is a testament to the power of blending acoustic and digital elements, offering an immersive listening experience that is as thought-provoking as it is beautiful.
