 This hauntingly beautiful contemporary piece for viola and fixed media presents an interplay between organic warmth and cold precision, creating a rich tapestry of sound that is both introspective and expansive. The viola's melodies weave through electronic textures that shift from distant echoes to pulsating drones, shimmering harmonics, and sharp percussive bursts. The harmonic structure oscillates between moments of stillness and sudden bursts of energy, while the use of space and texture creates an immersive listening experience.

The overall mood is contemplative yet dynamic, leaving the listener feeling a blend of technical brilliance, wonderment at creative possibilities, and a lingering sense of peace that lingers long after the final note fades. This piece is more than just a simple collaboration between human expression and technology; it's a journey through sound, bridging past traditions with future possibilities in a way that feels deeply personal yet universally resonant.
